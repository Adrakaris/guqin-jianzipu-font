# Hui positions

Hui positions are to be written differently, to allow for ALL combinations with only 26 ligatures

The **BOTTOM** hui position is written using /no, like /4, or /13

The **TOP** hui position is written using ^no, like ^4 or ^13

Where only a single ligature is needed, the **BOTTOM** one should be used.
